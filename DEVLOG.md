# Development log

This is a playground project to start learning flutter.

## 2020-12-09

```
flutter emulators --launch android9
flutter run
```

Things are getting simpler.

Still missing how to put breakpoints.

Starting to like `StatefulWidgets`

Learned how to transit from one 'page' to another.

So far, so good.

The installation setup MUST be followed exactly. For instance, download just the
android command line tools instead the entire android studio won't work.

The `flutter doctor` command is your best friend. From accept licenses to help
with devices (and emulators), it gives you the right path.

Be prepared to download lots of things, since it's still mobile development.
System images, sdks, build tools, and so on.

Do not forget to set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT / ANDROID_HOME.

Still pending to discover how to set a breakpoint.
